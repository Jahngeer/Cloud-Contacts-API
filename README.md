## 🎯 Project Overview
**Cloud Contacts API** is an application built on a core **Offline-First Architecture**. The application operates independently of active network availability; users can smoothly Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) contacts in offline mode. A background synchronization engine monitors network connectivity and executes an automatic bidirectional sync as soon as the internet connection is restored.

### 💎 Key Architectural Values & Features
* **Single Source of Truth:** The UI reads reactive stream data exclusively from the local SQLite cache (`contacts.db`), eliminating asynchronous screen flickering during layout rendering.
* **🎨 Seamless Native Splash Screen:** Features an integrated full-bleed branding welcome screen that completely handles native cold start overheads and renders edge-to-edge across all screen sizes.
* **⚡ Real-Time Search Filter:** Includes a high-performance search algorithm that offers instantaneous contact matching from the local database, allowing users to find contacts effortlessly.
* **📦 Native App Icon Launcher Integration:** Integrated with responsive native launcher icons optimized to fit the precise grid and display standards of Android, iOS, and Windows platforms.
* **Smart Binary Compression:** Compresses avatar images selected via the native image picker by up to 80% at runtime (`512x512` frame size), converting them into lightweight Base64 layers to prevent local cache lagging and remote server overloads.
* **State Preservation:** Retains pipeline entries locally within the sync engine during network failures rather than dumping or losing transient state data.

## ⚙️ Data Synchronization Engine

The application monitors and traces local modifications using a database-level **Sync State Machine**:



| Local Status Flag | Description / Operational Behavior | Target HTTP Verb |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SYNCED` | Data is perfectly unified across local storage and the MockAPI server. | *None* |
| `PENDING_INSERT` | Contact created while offline. Stored locally, waiting for connection. | `POST` |
| `PENDING_UPDATE` | Existing contact modified while offline. Updates queued locally. | `PUT` |
| `PENDING_DELETE` | Contact soft-deleted by user. Kept in cache until remote drop completes. | `DELETE` |

## 🚀 Installation & Build Guide

### Prerequisites
* Flutter SDK Setup (`^3.11.0` or later stable channel)
* System configured environment flags for Android SDK, iOS Xcode, or Windows C++ build tools.

### Step-by-Step Deployment

1. Clone the project repository from your shell:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com
   cd cloud_contacts_api
   ```

2. Fetch complete application package ecosystem dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **[Mandatory]** Generate or regenerate launcher icons and asset mappings natively for all platforms:
   ```bash
   dart run flutter_launcher_icons
   ```

4. Execute a thorough system workspace wipe to purge binary metadata overlaps:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

5. Compile and spin up the debugging runner on your current active workstation target:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
